## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS Modules

### What I learned

Through completing this challenge I got practice creating apps using react and useState. As well I was able to implement animations to the design and drop downs and style the image to be responsive for all screen sizes and using padding to show full background image while inside an empty div.

### Continued development

Going forward I would like to improve my use of HTML as in this project there were too many divs used that could be better used with sematic HTML. This was the first time implementing animations into my site so I plan on learning more about how they work and how they work with react.
